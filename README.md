# Portfolio_Chatbot
This is a chatbot I created to test my _**Dialogflow**_ chatbot.
I created this with basic html and css code and integrated the chatbot I created.
You can ask this bot about my work experience, skills, education and contact info.
The work experience is splitted in 4 types.
1. Chatbot Development
2. Data Analysis
3. Research
4. Transcription
You can also ask about my chatbot, data analysis, research and transcription experiences straight away.

Please download **Live Server** in GitHut to access and test the chatbot.

If you can't access it, try downloading zip file and try it.

If you face trouble accessing the chatbot, feel free to mail me at _dinesh2610m@gmail.com_ and give me a feedback on what went wrong and how to fix it.
